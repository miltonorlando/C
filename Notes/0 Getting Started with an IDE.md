# What is an IDE?
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an application that makes it easier for you to read, modify, and write new code.

On my journey, I utilized Code::Blocks for creating C programs.

#### You may use other IDEs if you want. 
It is completely up to you! It is all up to preference and functionality!

# Getting Started 
In order to use the Code::Blocks IDE, your computer will need to have two different pieces of software installed on it:

Get a copy of the Code::Blocks IDE

- <b>Go to the download page: http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26 </b>

Note: You need to install both the IDE AND the C compiler!
