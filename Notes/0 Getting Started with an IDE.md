# What is an IDE?
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an application that makes it easier for you to read, modify, and write new code.

On my journey, I utilized Code::Blocks for creating C programs.

#### You may use other IDEs if you want. 
It is completely up to you! It is all up to preference and functionality!
