## Intro
In this repository, I will share my notes and lessons that I have learned when studying the C programming Language.

C was one of the first programming languages that I learned. I hope this guide helps you on your journey to becoming a successful programmer!

# What is C?
- C was developed as a system programming language, and even after all this time, it remains incredibly popular.

- System languages are designed for performance while offering high-level programming tools and simplicity of access to the underlying hardware. Other languages might offer newerÂ language features, but their compilers and libraries are typically written in C.

- C has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.

# Why Do People like C?
Programming languages don't come in a one-size-fits-all style. Here are a few justifications for why C is unbeatable and practically required for specific applications:
- C is almost as portable as assembly language.
- The memory used for its code is smaller than for other languages.
- Good to use when a non-deterministic call to the garbage collector cannot be afforded.
- Arbitrary memory address access and pointer arithmetic is an important feature that makes C a perfect fit for system programming (operating systems and embedded systems).
